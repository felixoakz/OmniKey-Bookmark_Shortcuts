# OmniKey â€“ Bookmark Shortcuts

> **OmniKey** is a minimal, keyboard-first Chrome extension that lets you open bookmarks using custom shortcuts with almost no configuration.

---

## ðŸ¤” Motivation

The idea for **OmniKey** came from my time using Firefox, which has a built-in feature that lets you assign a keyword to any bookmark, allowing you to open it just by typing that keyword in the address bar.

When I switched back to Chrome, I missed that keyboard-driven flow. This extension was born from that needâ€”to bring a simple "type and launch" workflow to Chrome.

It started as a personal tool, but I decided to publish it for other keyboard-centric users and open-sourced it to welcome community suggestions and improvements.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

1. **Install** from the Chrome Web Store (link coming soon).

2. **Create a shortcut**:
   - Edit a bookmarkâ€™s title name and include a shortcut syntax at the end
   e.g., `Google Drive /gd`
         `Gmail /m`

3. **Use it**:
   - In the address bar, type `/`, then `Tab` (or `Space`)
   - Type `gd`, then hit `Enter`
   - For opening on a new tab add another backslash: `/ /gpt` will open a pre configured chatGPT on a new TAB.

4.  **Pro-Tip**: For an even faster flow, press `Alt+D` to focus the address bar, then type your shortcut sequence (e.g., `/` + `Tab` + `gh` + `Enter`).
